# Development Guidelines
guidelines:
  code_style:
    - "Use TypeScript strict mode"
    - "Follow Next.js App Router conventions"
    - "Use Tailwind CSS for styling"
    - "Prefer server components where possible"
    - "Use 'use client' only when necessary"

  naming:
    - "Components: PascalCase (e.g., KanbanCard)"
    - "Files: kebab-case (e.g., kanban-card.tsx)"
    - "Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., useUser)"
    - "API routes: REST conventions"

  git:
    - "Commit messages: conventional commits"
    - "Branch naming: feature/*, bugfix/*, hotfix/*"
    - "PR template with checklist"
